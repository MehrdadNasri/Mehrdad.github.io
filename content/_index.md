      text: |-
        I am a PhD student in Transportation Engineering at the University of Washington and a Research Assistant at the Smart Transportation Applications and Research (STAR) Laboratory in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. My research lies at the intersection of **transportation safety**, **intelligent transportation systems**, and **data-driven decision making**, with a strong emphasis on integrating **advanced statistical modeling**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence** with real-world transportation data.

      My work focuses on extracting actionable safety and mobility insights from heterogeneous data sources, including LiDAR, dashcam and surveillance videos, street-view imagery, smart sensors, loop detectors, connected vehicle data, and emerging next-generation sensing technologies. I develop and apply methods spanning discrete choice modeling, hierarchical and count regression models, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision for detection, tracking, segmentation, and trajectory prediction.

      At the **STAR Lab**, I contribute to federally and state-funded research projects in traffic safety and operations. My work includes the development of LLM-enabled digital twin systems for traffic safety management, integration of trajectory-based perception outputs with microscopic traffic simulation, and the design of surrogate safety measure analytics and visualization pipelines to support scenario-based safety evaluation and decision support.

      In parallel with my research, I have served as an instructor for graduate-level Traffic Systems Operations at the University of Washington, where I designed course materials, delivered lectures, and mentored students. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a transportation consultant and project manager on large-scale multimodal planning, logistics, and traffic safety projects, gaining extensive experience in applied modeling and stakeholder-driven transportation analysis.
